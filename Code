#include <Servo.h>
 // Create servo objects to control servos 
 // i recommend naming each servo as what it actually does, for example, "pinky" , "ring" , "middle" , "index" , "thumb" , this might not look as professional, but it makes coding much easier
 //  adding a comment after the semicolon with the name works too 
Servo servo1; //pinky
Servo servo2; 
Servo servo3; 
Servo servo4; 
Servo servo5; //thumb

 // Define pins 
const int buttonPin = 1;   // Push button pin 
const int servoPins[5] = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6};  // Servo pins from pinky to thumb --- this works, but can confuse you later if you want to tell which servo is assigned to which pin
//const int servoPins[5] = {11, 10, 9, 6, 5};

// the reason it isnt working is because you are using the wrong pins to control the servos, and id recommend assigning the pins differently too.
// servos require PWM pins, (you can find out which ones are PWN by searching for your arduino's "pinout") but you are using regular pins, which wont work
// PWM stands for "Pulse Width Modulation" and send a signal across a wire (the yellow one), which in this case, the servo reads as an angle
// for an arduino UNO, the PWM pins are 11, 10, 9, 6, 5 and 3, make sure to rewire the servos for the new code to work

// id also recommend assigning a pin to each servo individually, instead of as a set (uncomment the next line to make it work as actual code)

 // Variables to hold the servo positions
 int posOpen = 0;  // Open position
 int posClose = 180;  // Close position

 // Variable to hold the button state 
int buttonState = 0; 

 void setup() { 
 // Attach the servos to their respective pins
 servo1.attach(servoPins[0]); 
 servo2.attach(servoPins[1]); 
 servo3.attach(servoPins[2]); 
 servo4.attach(servoPins[3]); 
 servo5.attach(servoPins[4]); 

 // this way might be easier, as its easier to see the exact pin the servo is assigned, instead of pulling a value from servoPins[]
 // servo1.attach(11);
 // servo2.attach(10);
 // servo3.attach(9);
 // servo4.attach(6);
 // servo5.attach(5);

 // Initialize the push button pin as an input 
 pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT); 
} 
 void loop() { 
 // Read the state of the push button 
 buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin); 

 // If the button is pressed 
 if (buttonState == HIGH) {
 // Close the hand 
 moveServos(posClose);
 delay(1000);  // Wait for 1 second 
 // Open the hand 
 moveServos(posOpen); 
 delay(1000);  // Wait for 1 second
 } 

  //based off of the video i saw, a way to program the arm would be like this:   (delete the "/*" before "if" to uncomment it to make it actually run)

  /* if (buttonState == HIGH) {
    moveServos(posOpen); //make sure all fingers are open
    servo1.write(posClose); //close the first 4 fingers
    servo2.write(posClose);
    servo3.write(posClose);
    servo4.write(posClose);
    delay(2000); // wait 2 seconds
    servo5.write(posClose); //close the thumb
    delay(3000);
    moveServos(posOpen); //open the hand
    delay(1000);
  } */

} 

 // Function to move all servos to a specific position 
void moveServos(int position) { 
 servo1.write(position); 
 servo2.write(position);
 servo3.write(position); 
 servo4.write(position); 
 servo5.write(position); 
 // Wait for the servos to reach the position
